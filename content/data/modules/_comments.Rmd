
The lines of code in the scripts that start with a `#` in front are called comments. 
Every line that starts with a `#` is ignored and won't be run as R code. 
You can use the `#` to add notes in your script to make it easier for others and yourself to understand what is happening and why. 
You can also use comments to add warnings or instructions for others using your code.
