```{r arrange-price, warning = F}
# Arrange scrap items by price
scrap <- arrange(scrap, price_per_pound)

# View the top 6 rows
head(scrap)
```

## Big things first: `desc()`  {-}

To arrange a column in descending order with the biggest numbers on top, we use: `desc(price_per_pound)`

```{r desc-arrange, warning = F}
# Put most expensive items on top
scrap <- arrange(scrap, desc(price_per_pound))

# View the top 8 rows
head(scrap, 8)
```

Try arranging by more than one column, such as `price_per_pound` and `amount`. What happens?

When you save an arranged data table it maintains its order. This is perfect for sending people a quick __` Top 10 `__ list of pollutants or sites.
