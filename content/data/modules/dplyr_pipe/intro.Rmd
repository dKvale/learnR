__You can with the *pipe*!__ 

Use the `%>%` to chain functions together and make our scripts more streamlined.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>


#### Here are 2 ways the `%>%` is helpful: {-}


<div class="blockquote">
__`#1:`__ It eliminates the need for nested parentheses. 

Say you wanted to take the sum of 3 numbers and then take the log and then round the final result.
```{r maths, eval=F}
round(log(sum(c(10, 20, 30, 50))))

```


The code doesn't look much like the words we used to describe it. Let's pipe it so we can read the code from left to right.
```{r maths_better, eval = F}
c(10, 20, 30, 50) %>% sum() %>% log() %>% round()
```
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
__`#2:`__ We can combine many processing steps into one cohesive chunk.


Here are some of the functions we've applied to the scrap data so far:

```{r review, eval=F}
scrap <- arrange(scrap, desc(price_per_pound))

scrap <- filter(scrap, origin != "All")

scrap <- mutate(scrap, 
                scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                measure_method  = "REM-24")
```


We can use the `%>%` operator to pipe or chain them together.

```{r review-better, eval=F}

scrap <- scrap %>%
           arrange(desc(price_per_pound)) %>%
           filter(origin != "All") %>%
           mutate(scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                  measure_method  = "REM-24")

```

</div>


<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" style="color: green;"></i> Explore! {-}

Similar to above, use the `%>%` to combine the two Endor lines below.

```{r better_endor, eval=F}
# Filter to only magnetic_field measurements
mag_endor <- filter(air_endor, analyte == "magnetic_field")

# Add a date column to the filtered data
mag_endor <- mutate(mag_endor, date = mdy(start_run_date))
```
</div>
