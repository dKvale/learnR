
When you close R for the first time you'll see some options about saving your workspace, history, and other files. In general, we advise against saving these files. This will help RStudio open a fresh and clean environment every time you start it. And it's easy enough to re-run your script next time you open your project.

Follow these steps to set these options permanently, and not have to see the pop-up windows when you close R.

__Turn off *Save Workspace* __

1. Go to ` Tools > Global Options.... `  on the top RStudio navigation bar
1. On the first screen:
    - [ ] Uncheck Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup
    - Set _Save workspace to .RData on exit_ to ["Never?].
    - [ ] Uncheck Always save history
